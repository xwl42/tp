## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, user preferences, and timeslot data in JSON format and read them back into model objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefsStorage`, and `TimeslotsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the Model component (because the Storage component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the Model)
* delegates JSON conversion to classes such as `JsonSerializableAddressBook` / `JsonAdaptedPerson` for the address book and `JsonSerializableTimeslots` / `JsonAdaptedTimeslot` for timeslots.
* provides concrete implementations like `JsonAddressBookStorage`, `JsonUserPrefsStorage`, and `JsonTimeslotsStorage` which read/write files on disk.

The `StorageManager` class,
* composes the individual storage providers (address book, prefs, timeslots)
* exposes unified operations so `MainApp`, `Logic`, and other components access persistence through a single entry point

The timeslots file location is configurable via `UserPrefs` and the application will create or populate the file with sample timeslots when none is present.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
## Timeslots features

### Implementation overview
The Timeslots feature is implemented as a set of commands that parse user input into command objects, interact with the Model to read or mutate the stored timeslots, and return a CommandResult. Commands are implemented following the existing Command/Parser pattern used across the codebase (AddressBookParser -> XCommandParser -> XCommand). Some commands are read-only (e.g. get-timeslots) while others modify state (e.g. block-timeslot, unblock-timeslot, add-consultation, clear-timeslots).

### Data model
- Timeslot: stores start and end LocalDateTime; used for generic blocked timeslots.
- ConsultationTimeslot: extends Timeslot and includes an associated student name; serialized to JSON with an explicit studentName field.
- Timeslots are stored in a Timeslots collection inside ModelManager and are persisted by Storage (JsonTimeslotsStorage).

<puml src="diagrams/TimeslotsClassDiagram.puml" width="574" />

### Command flow
Typical lifecycle for a timeslot command:
1. User input → AddressBookParser creates the specific CommandParser.
2. Parser validates prefixes/arguments and constructs a Command instance (e.g., BlockTimeslotCommand).
3. LogicManager executes the Command (command.execute(model)).
4. Command manipulates the Model (reads or mutates Timeslots) and returns a CommandResult.
5. LogicManager persists changes (see Persistence & UI) and returns the CommandResult to the caller/UI.

Sequence diagrams:
- Block timeslot: <puml src="diagrams/BlockTimeslotSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />
- Unblock timeslot: <puml src="diagrams/UnblockTimeslotSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />
- Clear timeslots: <puml src="diagrams/ClearTimeslotsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />
- Get timeslots: <puml src="diagrams/GetTimeslotsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

### Persistence & UI
- Persistence: LogicManager is responsible for writing persistent files. After a successful command execution, LogicManager saves the address book and, if available, timeslots via StorageManager.saveAddressBook(...) and StorageManager.saveTimeslots(...).
- UI scheduling: Some commands (e.g., get-timeslots) produce a timeslot ranges payload inside CommandResult. When present, LogicManager schedules the UI update using Platform.runLater(() -> TimeslotsWindow.showTimetable(...)). This call:
  - Is performed asynchronously on the JavaFX thread to avoid blocking command execution.
  - Is guarded in LogicManager with a try/catch to ignore IllegalStateException in headless environments (unit tests).
  - Is only invoked when CommandResult contains non-empty timeslot ranges.

### Validation and error handling
- Argument parsing: CommandParsers validate required prefixes (ts/ and te/) and perform flexible datetime parsing (ISO and human-friendly formats). Parsers throw ParseException with user-facing messages on invalid format.
- Command execution: Commands validate business rules (e.g., no overlapping timeslots, consultations with duplicate student/time). On violation a CommandException is thrown with a clear message.
- Persistence errors: LogicManager translates IO or permission errors (IOException, AccessDeniedException) from Storage into CommandException so callers can surface the error to users.

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It stores a single previous state of the address book and
timeslots, stored internally as `previousAddressBookState` and `previousTimeslotsState`. Additionally, it implements
the following operations:

* `Model#saveAddressBook()` — Saves the current address book and timeslots state before modification.
* `Model#undoAddressBook()` — Restores the previous address book and timeslots state.
* `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` — Checks if there is a previous state available to undo to.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and
`Model#canUndoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the
initial address book and timeslots state, with `previousAddressBookState` and `previousTimeslotsState` set to `null`
(no previous state to undo to).

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState0.puml" with="574" />

**Step 2.** The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#saveAddressBook()` before deleting, saving the current state. After the deletion, the current state is
modified but the previous state preserves the state before deletion.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState1.puml" with="574" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveAddressBook()`, so the previous state will
not be updated.

</box>

**Step 3.** The user executes `add n/John Doe …​` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls
`Model#saveAddressBook()` before adding, which **replaces** the previous state with the current state (ab1),
then adds the new student.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState2.puml" with="574" />

**Step 4.** The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by
executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which restores the address book
to the previous state (ab1) and sets both `previousAddressBookState` and `previousTimeslotsState` to `null`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState3.puml" with="574" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If `previousAddressBookState` is `null`, then there is no previous state to restore. The `undo` command
uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than
attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important:** This implementation only supports undoing **one command** at a time. After undoing once, you must
execute another modifying command before you can undo again. There is no redo functionality.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" with="574" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" with="574" />

**Step 5.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book,
such as `list`, `find`, or `get-timeslots`, will not call `Model#saveAddressBook()`. Thus, the previous state remains `null`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState4.puml" with="574" />

**Step 6.** The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#saveAddressBook()` before clearing. The current state (ab1)
is saved as the previous state, then all persons are deleted, creating a new current state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/UndoState5.puml" with="574" />

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoCommand/SaveActivityDiagram.puml" with="574" />

#### Commands that support undo

The following commands call `Model#saveAddressBook()` and thus support undo:
- `add` - Adds a student
- `delete` - Deletes a student
- `edit` - Edits a student
- `clear` - Clears all students
- `marke` - Marks an exercise
- `marka` - Marks attendance
- `grade` - Marks grade of an assessment
- `block-timeslot` - Adds a timeslot
- `unblock-timeslot` - Unblock a timeslot
- `clear-timeslots` - Clears all timeslots
- `add-consultation` - Adds a consultation
- `set-week` - Sets current week

The following commands do NOT support undo (read-only commands):
- `list` - Lists all students
- `find` - Finds students
- `filter` - Filters students
- `sort` - Sorts students base on some criteria
- `get-timeslots` - Displays timeslots
- `get-consultations` - Gets consultation schedule
- `help` - Shows help
- `exit` - Exits the application

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves only one previous state (address book + timeslots).
    * Pros:
        * Simple to implement and understand.
        * Minimal memory usage (only doubles the data size at most).
        * No complex state management or pointer tracking.
    * Cons:
        * Cannot undo multiple commands in sequence.
        * Cannot undo a command once a new data-modifying command is executed.
        * No redo functionality.

* **Alternative 2:** Save entire history in a list with pointer.
    * Pros:
        * Can undo multiple commands in sequence.
        * Supports redo functionality.
    * Cons:
        * More complex to implement and maintain.
        * Higher memory usage (stores multiple states in a list).
        * Need to carefully manage state pointer and list boundaries.

* **Alternative 3:** Individual command knows how to undo itself (Command Pattern with undo).
    * Pros:
        * Memory efficient (only store minimal data needed to reverse each command).
        * Can undo multiple commands.
        * Each command encapsulates its own undo logic.
    * Cons:
        * Much more complex - every command must implement its own undo logic.
        * Must ensure correctness of each command's undo implementation.
        * Harder to maintain and test.
        * Increased development time for new commands.

**Rationale for Alternative 1:** For the scope of this project, a simple single-level undo is sufficient for most use
cases. Users typically need to undo only their most recent action, and the simplicity of implementation outweighs the
benefits of a full undo/redo stack. The minimal memory overhead and straightforward logic make this approach ideal for
a student project with limited development time.

#### Future enhancements

* **Multiple undo levels:** Implement a full history stack (Alternative 2) to support undoing multiple commands in
  sequence. This would involve storing a list of states and maintaining a current state pointer.

* **Redo functionality:** Allow users to redo commands that were undone. This would require preserving the "future"
  states after an undo operation until a new modifying command is executed.

* **Selective undo:** Allow undoing specific commands in history rather than just the most recent one. This would
  require implementing Alternative 3 with command-specific undo logic.

* **Undo command confirmation:** For destructive commands like `clear`, prompt the user to confirm before executing,
  reducing the need for undo in the first place.

### **Feature: Multi-Index Inputs**

#### Overview

LambdaLab supports commands that can target **multiple students at once** through the use of **multi-index inputs**.  
This feature is powered by the `MultiIndex` and `MultiIndexCommand` classes, which together allow users to specify **a single index** (e.g., `2`) or **a contiguous range** (e.g., `1:5`) when executing commands.

This enables bulk operations such as grading, marking attendance, or updating exercises — all in one concise command.

---

#### Motivation

Before introducing this feature, commands like `marka`, `marke`, and `grade` could only operate on **one student** at a time.  
This was inefficient for Teaching Assistants managing large classes, as they frequently needed to update the same record (e.g., lab attendance or exam results) for an entire group.

By introducing **multi-index inputs**, LambdaLab allows a single command to efficiently modify multiple students’ data, improving usability and productivity during busy grading or lab sessions.

---

#### Implementation

## MultiIndex
The `MultiIndex` class represents a list of one or more indices that is written as the syntax as shown here:

# MultiIndex syntax
- A **single index** (e.g., `1` → only the first student), or
- A **range of indices** (e.g., `1:5` → students 1 through 5, inclusive).

It exposes methods such as:
- `isSingle()` — checks if the command applies to one student only.
- `toIndexList()` — returns a list of all `Index` objects represented by the multi-index input.

## MultiIndexCommand
Commands that use this feature extend the abstract class `MultiIndexCommand`,
which defines a template for commands that support updates for multiple students at once using the 
[MultiIndex syntax](#multiindex-syntax).

Each subclass:
1. Implements `applyActionToPerson(Model model, Person person)` — defining how each student is modified.
2. Optionally overrides `buildResult(List<Person> updatedPersons)` to customize the final success message.

**Subclasses that extend `MultiIndexCommand` :**

| Command Class           | Command Word | Description                              |
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `MarkAttendanceCommand`  | `marka`       | Marks lab attendances.                   |
| `MarkExerciseCommand`    | `marke`       | Marks exercises for completion.          |
| `GradeCommand`           | `grade`       | Marks exams as passed or failed.         |
| `DeleteCommand`          | `delete`      | Deletes students from LambdaLab.           |
| `EditCommand`            | `edit`        | Edits students in LambdaLab.               |

---

#### Example Usage

**Example 1: Single Index**
marka 5 l/3 s/n - Marks Lab 3 as *absent* for the student at the (one-based) index of 5 of the student list.

**Example 2: Range of Indices**
grade 1:3 en/midterm s/y  - Marks the *Midterm* exam as *passed* for student 1.
A sequence diagram for the execution of this command is shown over here:

<puml src="diagrams/GradeCommand/GradeSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800" />

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Code Reuse**  
The iteration and validation logic for applying an action to multiple students is centralized within `MultiIndexCommand`.  
This ensures consistent behavior across all commands that support bulk modification.

**Aspect: Robustness**  
If any index in the provided range is invalid (e.g., out of bounds), the command throws a `CommandException` before making any modifications.
>

**Aspect: Extensibility**  
Future commands that require multi-student operations (e.g., adding group tags or resetting student progress) can easily extend `MultiIndexCommand` without duplicating logic.

---

#### Future Enhancements

* **Partial Execution Reports:**  
  Allow commands to apply valid operations even if some indices fail, returning a summary report of successes and failures.

* **Parallel Execution:**  
  For large datasets, multi-index operations could be processed concurrently for improved performance.

### **Feature: Displaying Trackable Data**

#### Overview

LambdaLab displays each student’s academic progress using **trackable components**, which visually represent data such as **exercise completion**, **lab attendance**, and **exam performance**.  
This feature leverages the `Trackable` interface and its implementing classes to unify how progress information is retrieved and displayed within the UI.

Each trackable component defines both:
- The **status colours** (e.g., green, red, grey) that indicate the current state.
- The **labels** (e.g., EX1, L5, MIDTERM) used to identify individual tracked items.

---

#### Motivation

Previously, progress indicators for labs, exercises, and exams existed only as stored data, without any visual representation on the student card.  
Teaching Assistants had to rely on manual inspection or individual commands to check each student’s record, which was slow and error-prone.

The **Display Trackable** feature introduces a clear and intuitive visualization of progress through coloured labels.  
This allows Teaching Assistants to instantly gauge student performance and identify those who are struggling — directly from the main student list.

---

#### Implementation

#### Implementation

The **Trackable Display** feature enables LambdaLab to visually represent a student’s **exercises**, **lab attendance**, and **exam results** in a consistent and colour-coded format.

This is achieved through the `Trackable` interface, which standardizes how trackable data is exposed to the UI.  
Each of the following classes implements `Trackable`:
- `ExerciseTracker` – tracks completion status of exercises.
- `LabList` – tracks attendance for lab sessions.
- `GradeMap` – tracks examination results.

When a `PersonCard` is created, it directly retrieves these three trackers from the `Person` object:
1. `person.getExerciseTracker()`
2. `person.getLabAttendanceList()`
3. `person.getGradeMap()`

For each tracker, the `PersonCard`:
- Calls `getLabels()` to obtain display names (e.g., **EX1**, **L3**, **MIDTERM**).
- Calls `getTrackerColours()` to obtain their corresponding colour codes (`GREEN`, `GREY`, or `RED`).
- Dynamically generates a label for each item and applies the appropriate CSS class based on its colour.

This design cleanly separates **model data** from **UI rendering**, ensuring that any future updates to how data is displayed require no changes to the model logic.

<puml src="diagrams/Trackable/TrackableClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Reusability**  
The abstraction of the `Trackable` interface allows all progress-tracking components to share the same rendering logic, reducing code duplication and simplifying maintenance.

**Aspect: Extensibility**  
Future features such as project submissions or participation tracking can easily be integrated by implementing the same interface.

**Aspect: Visual Consistency**  
Colours and font styles are centrally managed through CSS, ensuring that every type of status indicator follows the same visual pattern.

---

#### Example

Each student card displays their current progress in three areas:

| Category | Green Meaning | Grey Meaning | Red Meaning |
|:----------|:---------------|:--------------|:-------------|
| **Lab** | Attended | Not conducted yet | Absent |
| **Exercise** | Completed | Not conducted | Overdue |
| **Exam** | Passed | Not graded | Failed |

This provides a concise and visual summary of each student’s standing in the course.

---

#### Future Enhancements

* **Dynamic Updates:**  
  Allow trackable status colours to update in real time when a record changes, without requiring a full refresh.

* **Tooltips:**  
  Provide contextual information (e.g., submission dates or marks) when hovering over each label.

* **Custom Colour Themes:**  
  Allow instructors to customize the colour scheme for accessibility or course preferences.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Find Feature:

#### Current Implementation
The `find` mechanism performs a multi-keyword search over student records with **presence-only selectors** to restrict which fields are searched.
Keywords are taken from the preamble (e.g., `find alice bob`), while empty selectors (e.g., `n/`, `g/`) 
act as flags to limit the searched fields. If no selectors are provided, all supported fields are searched.

Each selector creates a separate `Predicate` with the `keywords` then they are combined into a combined `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate`
and passed to a `FindCommand`. The command then updates the model’s filtered list in one step.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the key interactions for `execute("find <KEYWORD> [selectors]")`.

<puml src="diagrams/findCommand/find.puml" width="574" />

#### Parsing & Validation
- `FindCommandParser` tokenises input into a preamble and selectors.
- It rejects inputs with **no keywords** or **non-empty selectors** (e.g., `n/Alice`) to enforce presence-only flags.
- Selected fields are determined from which selectors appear; otherwise all fields are chosen.
- Per-field predicates are OR-combined into a single `PersonContainsKeywordPredicate`
that matches when **any** keyword is a case-insensitive **substring** of **any** selected field.

#### Model Update
- `FindCommand#execute(Model)` calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` once.
- The UI observes the filtered list and refreshes automatically.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `LambdaLab` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**Use case: Grade an exercise**

**Precondition: A student has submitted their programming exercise**

**MSS**

1.  User receives notification that a student has submitted the exercise
2.  User navigates to student's submission on GitHub via notification
3.  User returns after grading student's submission on GitHub
4.  User marks exercise as graded in LambdaLab
5.  LambdaLab updates statistics
    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 1a. User doesn't want to grade student's exercise now
    * 1a1. User dismisses the notification
      Use case ends.
* 1b. User accidentally dismisses notification
    * 1b1. User goes to student's profile
    * 1b2. User navigates to student's submission on GitHub via link in student's profile
      Use case resumes at Step 3


**Use case: Mark student attendance**

**MSS**

1.  User wants to mark attendance, enters student name and lab number using the command format
2.  LambdaLab validates the student name and lab number
3.  LambdaLab marks the student’s attendance for the specified lab
4.  LambdaLab confirms: “Attendance for <studentName> marked for lab number <labNumber>”
    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 1a. User provides an empty name or a name with invalid characters
    * 1a1. LambdaLab displays error message: “Invalid name”
    * 1a2. User re-enters a valid name
      Use case resumes at Step 2
* 1b. User provides an invalid lab number (non-numeric, zero, negative, or out-of-range)
    * 1b1. System displays error message: “Invalid lab number”
    * 1b2. User re-enters a valid lab number
      Use case resumes at Step 2
* 3a. Attendance for the student in that lab number has already been marked
    * 3a1. LambdaLab displays: “Attendance already marked for <studentName> in lab number <labNumber>”
      Use case ends.


**Use case: Schedule a consultation**

**Precondition: User has uploaded his schedule**

**Actor:User**

**MSS**
1. User views all the periods of available time he has
2. User inputs a desired consultation time slot
3. Time slot is saved into his schedule
4. A day before the consultation, the user will be reminded of it

**Extensions**
* 2a. User inputs an invalid consultation slot
    * 1a1. User is prompted to enter a valid consultation slot

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The system should respond to any command within 1 second.
5.  Core functionalities should be covered by automated tests to ensure that future changes do not break the existing features
6.  Users should be able to run the application simply by executing a JAR file, without needing to run an installer.
7.  Should be able to function fully offline.
8.  Date persistence should not depend on an external database system. Storage should be file-based and embedded.
9.  User data should not be lost due to unexpected situations (e.g., unexpected shutdowns).
10. Should be able to support multiple screen resolutions (e.g., 1280×720 and above) without layout issues.
